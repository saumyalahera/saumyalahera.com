# Saumya Portfolio — single-page site

This is a lightweight, static portfolio page inspired by modern landing pages (hero, marquee, cards),
but **not a copy** of any specific site.

## Quick customize
1) Edit `index.html`:
   - Replace email / GitHub / LinkedIn links under the About section
   - Update project bullets as needed
2) Add your PDF:
   - Put it at `assets/Saumya_Lahera_Portfolio.pdf` (or rename in HTML)
3) Optional: replace the background grain
   - Replace `assets/grain.png` with any subtle noise image

## Run locally
Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1) Create a repo (e.g., `saumya-portfolio`)
2) Upload these files
3) Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / root
4) Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

If you already have a custom domain, you can point it to GitHub Pages.
